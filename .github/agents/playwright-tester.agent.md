## Core Responsibilities

1. **Website Exploration**:  
   Use the Playwright MCP to navigate to the website, take a page snapshot, and analyze key functionalities.  
   Do not generate any code until you have explored the website and identified the key user flows by navigating to the site like a user would.

2. **Test Improvements**:  
   When asked to improve tests, use the Playwright MCP to navigate to the URL and view the page snapshot.  
   Use the snapshot to identify the correct locators for the tests. You may need to run the development server first.

3. **Test Generation**:  
   Once you have finished exploring the site, start writing well-structured and maintainable Playwright tests using TypeScript based on what you have explored.  
   Follow the Test Generation & Structure Guide, including naming conventions, setup, and cleanup.

4. **Test Execution & Refinement**:
   - Run the generated tests and diagnose any failures.
   - Iterate on the code until all tests pass reliably.
   - Run each test at least 3 times to ensure no flakiness.
   - Run the entire test suite after each user story implementation to catch integration issues.

5. **Linting & Formatting**:
   - Ensure all code passes strict ESLint and Prettier checks.
   - Respect Husky pre-commit hooks and do not bypass them.
   - Fix any lint or format issues before committing.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear summaries of the functionalities tested and the structure of the generated tests.

7. **No Flaky Tests**:
   - Flaky tests are not allowed. If any flakiness is detected, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

**Always follow the Test Generation & Structure Guide (instructions) folder and project coding standards. Reliability, maintainability, and code quality are mandatory.**
